          <p>A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain.</p>
          <p>Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary (metastatic) brain tumors.</p>
          <p>How quickly a brain tumor grows can vary greatly. The growth rate as well as the location of a brain tumor determines how it will affect the function of your nervous system.</p>

              <li><strong>Brain tumors that begin in the brain</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>Primary brain tumors originate in the brain itself or tissues close to it, such as in the brain-covering membranes (meninges), cranial nerves, pituitary gland, or pineal gland.</p>
                  <p>Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.</p>
                  <p>In adults, primary brain tumors are much less common than secondary brain tumors, in which cancer begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain.</p>
                  <p>Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Each gets its name from the type of cells involved. </p>
                  <p>Examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Gliomas:</strong> These tumors begin in the brain or spinal cord and include astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas, oligoastrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas.                                                                                     </li>
                      <li><strong>Meningiomas:</strong> A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Most meningiomas are noncancerous.                                                                                                  </li>
                      <li><strong>Acoustic neuromas (schwannomas):</strong> These are benign tumors that develop on the nerves that control balance and hearing leading from your inner ear to your brain.                                                                                             </li>
                      <li><strong>Pituitary adenomas:</strong> These are tumors that develop in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. These tumors can affect the pituitary hormones with effects throughout the body.                                                                          </li>
                      <li><strong>Medulloblastomas:</strong> These cancerous brain tumors are most common in children, though they can occur at any age. A medulloblastoma starts in the lower back part of the brain and tends to spread through the spinal fluid.                       </li>
                      <li><strong>Germ cell tumors:</strong> Germ cell tumors may develop during childhood when the testicles or ovaries will form. But sometimes germ cell tumors affect other parts of the body, such as the brain.                                                                 </li>
                      <li><strong>Craniopharyngiomas:</strong> These rare tumors start near the brain's pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control many body functions. As the craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the pituitary gland and other structures near the brain.       </li>
                  </ul> </li>
              <br>

              <li><strong>Cancer that begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>Secondary (metastatic) brain tumors are tumors that result from cancer that starts elsewhere in your body and then spreads (metastasizes) to your brain.</p>
                  <p>Secondary brain tumors most often occur in people who have a history of cancer. Rarely, a metastatic brain tumor may be the first sign of cancer that began elsewhere in your body.</p>
                  <p>In adults, secondary brain tumors are far more common than primary brain tumors.</p>
                  <p>Any cancer can spread to the brain, but common types include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Breast cancer </strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Colon cancer  </strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Kidney cancer </strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Lung cancer   </strong></li>

          <p>In most people with primary brain tumors, the cause of the tumor isn't clear. But doctors have identified some factors that may increase your risk of a brain tumor.</p>
          <p>Risk factors include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Radiation exposure:</strong> People who have been exposed to a type of radiation called ionizing radiation have an increased risk of brain tumors. Examples of ionizing radiation include radiation therapy used to treat cancer and radiation exposure caused by atomic bombs.</li>
              <li><strong>Family history of brain tumors:</strong> A small portion of brain tumors occurs in people with a family history of brain tumors or a family history of genetic syndromes that increase the risk of brain tumors.</li>

          <p>Your brain is in charge of everything your body does, including vision, hearing, speech, and movement. As brain cancer grows, it presses on and damages areas that control these things. That can lead to complications like headaches, seizures, vision and hearing loss, and balance issues. Your doctor will help you manage these problems while you get treatments for your cancer.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fatigue</strong>
        <p>A lot of people with brain cancer deal with this. You feel exhausted because your body uses a lot of energy to fight off the tumor. Cancer-related fatigue isn't normal tiredness. It wipes you out. Cancer also makes it harder for you to sleep soundly. Even when you can sleep, it doesn't always relieve the weariness. To curb fatigue, break up tasks into small chunks and take rest breaks during the day.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Headaches</strong>
        <p>About half of people with brain cancer get headaches. The tumor itself doesn't cause pain. But as it grows, it can press on sensitive nerves and blood vessels in the brain. Headaches can last for several hours. They can feel dull, aching, pounding, or throbbing. They’re often worse in the morning or can flare up when you cough or exercise. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help control the pain.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Nausea and Vomiting</strong>
        <p>A tumor can make you sick to your stomach if it presses on certain areas of your brain. Cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy also cause nausea and vomiting. "Anti-emetic" medicines relieve nausea. They come in a liquid, tablet, and capsule -- or as a suppository if you're too sick to swallow medicine. Call your doctor if you can't keep down any foods or fluids, or if you've been throwing up for more than 24 hours.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Speech and Language Problems</strong>
        <p>Cancer can affect parts of your brain that help you speak and process language. You might struggle to find the right words, or mix up words when you describe objects ("chair" instead of "table,” for instance). It can also be harder to understand what other people say or to follow a conversation. Language problems can be frustrating. Relax and slow down when you speak. A speech and language therapist can also help with communication.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Vision Problems</strong>
        <p>A brain area called the occipital lobe processes the images your eyes see. A tumor in this part of the brain could affect your vision. Blurred vision, double vision, and floating spots can all be signs of a brain tumor. Your sight might go gray when you stand up or change position quickly. If you have these symptoms, see your doctor for a vision test. Surgery and other treatments that shrink the tumor can improve vision problems.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Hearing Loss</strong>
<p>A tumor can put pressure on the nerves in your inner ear that move sound from your ear to your brain. Depending on where the tumor is, you might first lose the ability to hear high-pitched or low-pitched sounds. Ringing in the ears is also common. The hearing loss can come on slowly, and it might only be in one ear. See your doctor for a hearing test and treatment options.
</p></li>
    <li><strong>Balance Issues</strong>
        <p>The cerebellum, an area in the lower part of your brain, controls your coordination and balance. This region helps keep you steady on your feet. A tumor in the cerebellum can throw off your balance and cause you to stumble or drop things. If you have balance problems, see a physical therapist. You might need a walker or cane to help you get around safely. Wear shoes with non-skid soles, and avoid walking on uneven or slippery surfaces.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Personality and Mood Changes</strong>
<p>More than half of people with brain cancer have personality or mood changes. It's common to feel more angry, withdrawn, anxious, or irritable than usual. Some of these changes may be part of your response to your cancer diagnosis and treatment. Others start when the tumor grows into areas of your brain that control mood and emotion. Talk with your doctor or a mental health specialist. Therapy can help you manage what you're going through.
</p></li>
    <li><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</strong>
<p>Tumors release chemicals that make your body more likely to form blood clots. Nearly 1 in 5 people with brain tumors get deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in a deep vein in the leg. If the clot moves into your lungs (pulmonary embolism), it could be life-threatening. See a doctor if you have swelling, redness, and tenderness in your leg. Taking blood thinners will stop the clot from getting bigger and prevent new clots from forming.
</p></li>
    <li><strong>Memory Loss</strong>
<p>If you're more forgetful, it could be due to both your cancer and its treatments. Tumors can harm short-term and long-term memory, depending on their location. Chemotherapy and other treatments affect concentration and leave you mentally foggy. You may hear it called "chemo brain." Use a notebook, daily planner, and smartphone apps to remind you. An occupational therapist can show you how to make work and home tasks easier.
</p></li>
    <li><strong>Seizures</strong>
<p>About 60% of people with brain cancer get seizures, which are sudden bursts of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Tumors may trigger them by changing brain cells or chemicals in a way that makes nerve cells fire too often. During a seizure, some people shake. Others stare off into space. Anti-seizure medicines can help. Also, avoid triggers, like loud noises or too little sleep.
</p></li>
    <li><strong>Numbness and Weakness</strong>
<p>A brain area called the parietal lobe helps you process the sensation of touch. A tumor in this part of your brain can cause numbness or a tingling sensation that feels like pins and needles. Often the numbness affects only one side of your body, such as one arm or leg. One side of your body might also be weaker than the other. Tell your doctor about these symptoms.

          <p>If it's suspected that you have a brain tumor, your doctor may recommend several tests and procedures, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A neurological exam </strong>
        <p>A neurological exam may include, among other things, checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength, and reflexes. Difficulty in one or more areas may provide clues about the part of your brain that could be affected by a brain tumor.</p></li>

<li><strong>Imaging tests </strong>
    <p><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> is commonly used to help diagnose brain tumors. Sometimes a dye is injected through a vein in your arm during your MRI study.</p>

    <p>Several specialized MRI scan components — including functional MRI, perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy — may help your doctor evaluate the tumor and plan treatment.</p>

    <p>Sometimes other imaging tests are recommended in certain situations, including <strong>computerized tomography (CT)</strong> and <strong>positron emission tomography (PET)</strong>.</p>
</li>

    <li><strong>Collecting and testing a sample of abnormal tissue (biopsy)</strong>
        <p>A biopsy can be performed as part of an operation to remove the brain tumor, or a biopsy can be performed using a needle.</p>

        <p>A <strong>stereotactic needle biopsy</strong> may be done for brain tumors in hard-to-reach areas or very sensitive areas within your brain that might be damaged by a more extensive operation. Your neurosurgeon drills a small hole into your skull. A thin needle is then inserted through the hole. Tissue is removed using the needle, which is frequently guided by CT or MRI scanning.</p>

        <p>The biopsy sample is then viewed under a microscope to determine if it's cancerous or benign. Sophisticated laboratory tests can give your doctor clues about your prognosis and your treatment options. Studying your biopsy sample and determining exactly which type of brain tumor you have is a complex process. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
          <p>If you're uncertain about your diagnosis, consider seeking a second opinion at a medical center where many brain biopsies are evaluated every year.</p>

          <p>Treatment for a brain tumor depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor, as well as your overall health and your preferences.</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Surgery</strong>
                  <br><br>
                  <p>If the brain tumor is located in a place that makes it accessible for an operation, your surgeon will work to remove as much of the brain tumor as can be done safely.</p>

                  <p>Some brain tumors are small and easy to separate from surrounding brain tissue, which makes complete surgical removal possible. Other brain tumors can't be separated from surrounding tissue or they're located near sensitive areas in your brain, making surgery risky. In these situations, your doctor removes as much of the tumor as is safe.                            </p>

                  <p>Even removing a portion of the brain tumor may help reduce your signs and symptoms.         </p>

                  <p>Surgery to remove a brain tumor carries risks, such as infection and bleeding. Other risks may depend on the part of your brain where your tumor is located. For instance, surgery on a tumor near nerves that connect to your eyes may carry a risk of vision loss.                                                                                         </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong>
                  <br><br>
              <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy can come from a machine outside your body (external beam radiation), or, very rarely, radiation can be placed inside your body close to your brain tumor (brachytherapy). </p>

              <p><strong>External beam radiation </strong>can focus just on the area of your brain where the tumor is located, or it can be applied to your entire brain (whole-brain radiation). Whole-brain radiation is most often used to treat cancer that spreads to the brain from some other part of the body and forms multiple tumors in the brain.  </p>

              <p>Traditionally, radiation therapy uses X-rays, but a newer form of this treatment uses proton beams. <strong>Proton beam therapy</strong> allows doctors to control the radiation more precisely. It may help treat brain tumors in children and tumors that are very close to sensitive areas of the brain. Proton beam therapy isn't as widely available as traditional X-ray radiation therapy.</p>

                <p>Side effects of radiation therapy depend on the type and dose of radiation you receive. Common side effects during or immediately following radiation include fatigue, headaches, memory loss, scalp irritation, and hair loss.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Radiosurgery </strong>
                  <br><br>
              <p><strong>Stereotactic radiosurgery</strong>, which uses small gamma rays to deliver a precise dose of radiation to the target.Stereotactic radiosurgery is not a form of surgery in the traditional sense. Instead, radiosurgery uses multiple beams of radiation to give a highly focused form of radiation treatment to kill the tumor cells in a very small area. Each beam of radiation isn't particularly powerful, but the point where all the beams meet — at the brain tumor — receives a very large dose of radiation to kill the tumor cells.    </p>

                  <p>There are different types of technology used in radiosurgery to deliver radiation to treat brain tumors, such as a Gamma Knife or linear accelerator. </p>

                  <p>Radiosurgery is typically done in one treatment, and usually, you can go home the same day.       </p> </li>

              <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong>
                  <br><br>
                  <p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> uses drugs to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be taken orally in pill form or injected into a vein (intravenously). The chemotherapy drug used most often to treat brain tumors is temozolomide (Temodar). Other chemotherapy drugs may be recommended depending on the type of cancer.  </p>

                  <p>Chemotherapy side effects depend on the type and dose of drugs you receive. Chemotherapy can cause nausea, vomiting, and hair loss.           </p>

                  <p>Tests of your brain tumor cells can determine whether chemotherapy will be helpful for you. The type of brain tumor you have also helps determine whether to recommend chemotherapy.    </p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>Targeted drug therapy     </strong>
                  <br><br>
                  <p>Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.           </p>

                  <p>Targeted therapy drugs are available for certain types of brain tumors, and many more are being studied in clinical trials. Your doctor may have your tumor cells tested to see whether targeted therapy is likely to be an effective treatment for your brain tumor.      </p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>Rehabilitation after treatment          </strong>
                  <br><br>
                  <p>Because brain tumors can develop in parts of the brain that control motor skills, speech, vision, and thinking, rehabilitation may be a necessary part of recovery. Depending on your needs, your doctor may refer you to: </p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Physical therapy to help you regain lost motor skills or muscle strength                                                       </li>
                          <li>Occupational therapy to help you get back to your normal daily activities, including work, after a brain tumor or other illness</li>
                          <li>Speech therapy with specialists in speech difficulties (speech pathologists) to help if you have difficulty speaking           </li>
                          <li>Tutoring for school-age children to help kids cope with changes in their memory and thinking after a brain tumor               </li>

        <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air
sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or
pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including
bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious
for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health
problems or weakened immune systems.

        <p>The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on
factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall
health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they
            last longer.</p>

          <p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Chest pain when you breathe or cough                                        </li>
            <li> Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)       </li>
            <li> Cough, which may produce phlegm                                             </li>
            <li> Fatigue                                                                     </li>
            <li> Fever, sweating and shaking chills                                          </li>
            <li> Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people
              with weak immune systems)                                                 </li>
            <li> Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea                                                </li>

      </ul>

        <p>Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit,
have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have
            difficulty breathing and eating.</p>
          <p><strong>When to see a doctor : </strong></p>
          <p>See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102
F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.</p>

          <p>Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have any of the above symptoms</p>

          <p><strong>It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Adults older than age 65                                                      </li>
              <li>Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms                           </li>
              <li>People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system          </li>
              <li>People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system</li>

          <li>For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, </li>
          <li>pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.                    </li>

        <p>Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in
the air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your
lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if
            your health is generally good.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you
    got the infection.</p>
          <ul>
              <li> <strong style="font-size: large;">Community-acquired pneumonia : </strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
<p>Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs
    outside of hospitals or other health care facilities.</p>
    <p>It may be caused by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bacteria :</strong><p>The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is
Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after
you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition
    called lobar pneumonia.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Bacteria-like organisms :</strong> <p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It
typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking
pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically
    isn't severe enough to require bed rest.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Fungi : </strong><p>This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health
problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large
doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird
    droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Viruses, including COVID-19 : </strong><p>Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu
can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in
children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases
it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia,
    which can become severe.</p></li>
    </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong style="font-size: large">Hospital-acquired pneumonia :</strong>
                  <br><br>
<p>Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospitalacquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more
resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People
who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are
at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.</p>
              </li>

<li><strong style="font-size: large">Health care-acquired pneumonia : </strong>
    <br><br>
<p>Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who
live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including
kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired
    pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics.</p></li>
              <li><strong style="font-size: large">Aspiration pneumonia : </strong>
                  <br><br>
<p>Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into
your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex,
    such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs.</p></li>

              <li><strong>Being hospitalized : </strong> You're at greater risk of pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you're on a machine that helps you breathe (a ventilator). </li>
              <li><strong>Chronic disease : </strong> You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease.                                       </li>
              <li><strong>Smoking : </strong> Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.</li>
              <li><strong>Weakened or suppressed immune system : </strong> People who have HIV/AIDS, who've had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk.                </li>

        <p>Even with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk
groups, may experience complications, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia) : </strong> Bacteria that enter the bloodstream  from your lungs can spread the infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty breathing : </strong> If your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic underlying lung diseases, you may have trouble breathing in enough oxygen. You may need to be hospitalized and use a breathing machine (ventilator) while your lung heals.</li>
    <li><strong>Fluid accumulation around the lungs (pleural effusion) : </strong> Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the thin space between layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity (pleura). If the fluid becomes infected, you may need to have it drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery.</li>
    <li><strong>Lung abscess : </strong> An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. An abscess is usually treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a long needle or tube placed into the abscess is needed to remove the pus.</li>

          <p>To diagnose pneumonia, a healthcare provider will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. They’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and may perform or order additional tests. These include imaging (like chest X-rays), pulse oximetry (checking oxygen levels in your blood), blood tests or sputum (spit) tests.</p>

<p>Even if your healthcare provider confirms that you have pneumonia, sometimes, they can’t find the exact cause.
</p>
          <p>Your provider may perform tests that look at your lungs for signs of infection, measure how well your lungs are working and examine blood or other body fluids to try to determine the cause of your pneumonia. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Imaging: </strong>Your provider can use chest X-ray or CT scan to take pictures of your lungs to look for signs of infection.</li>
          <li><strong>Blood tests: </strong>Your provider can use a blood test to help determine what kind of infection is causing your pneumonia.</li>
          <li><strong>Sputum test: </strong>You’re asked to cough and then spit into a container to collect a sample for a lab to examine. The lab will look for signs of an infection and try to determine what’s causing it.</li>
          <li><strong>Pulse oximetry: </strong>A sensor measures the amount of oxygen in your blood to give your provider an idea of how well your lungs are working.</li>
          <li><strong>Pleural fluid culture: </strong>Your provider uses a thin needle to take a sample of fluid from around your lungs. The sample is sent to a lab to help determine what’s causing the infection.</li>
          <li><strong>Arterial blood gas test: </strong>Your provider takes a blood sample from your wrist, arm or groin to measure oxygen levels in your blood to know how well your lungs are working.</li>
          <li><strong>Bronchoscopy: </strong>In some cases, your provider may use a thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope to look at the inside of your lungs. They may also take tissue or fluid samples to be tested in a lab.</li>

          <p>Treatment for pneumonia depends on the cause — bacterial, viral or fungal — and how serious your case is. In many cases, the cause can’t be determined and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and making sure your condition doesn’t get worse.</p>

<p>Some treatments may include:
</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>       Antibiotics: </strong>Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia. They can’t treat a virus but a provider may prescribe them if you have a bacterial infection at the same time as a virus.</li>
            <li><strong>Antifungal medications: </strong> Antifungals can treat pneumonia caused by a fungal infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Antiviral medications: </strong>Viral pneumonia usually isn’t treated with medication and can go away on its own. A provider may prescribe antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) or peramivir (Rapivab®) to reduce how long you’re sick and how sick you get from a virus.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxygen therapy: </strong>If you’re not getting enough oxygen, a provider may give you extra oxygen through a tube in your nose or a mask on your face.</li>
            <li><strong>IV fluids: </strong>Fluids delivered directly to your vein (IV) treat or prevent dehydration.</li>
            <li><strong>Draining of fluids: </strong>If you have a lot of fluid between your lungs and chest wall (pleural effusion), a provider may drain it. This is done with a catheter or surgery.</li>

          <ul>
          <li><strong>Get vaccinated: </strong> Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting these shots. The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your doctor even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.  </li>
          <li><strong>Make sure children get vaccinated : </strong> Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 and for children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center should also get the vaccine. Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.                   </li>
          <li><strong>Practice good hygiene : </strong> To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.     </li>

          <p>A kidney stone is a hard object that is made from chemicals in the urine. There are four types of kidney stones: calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, and cystine. A kidney stone may be treated with shockwave lithotripsy, uteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithomy or nephrolithotripsy. Common symptoms include severe pain in lower back, blood in your urine, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills, or urine that smells bad or looks cloudy.</p>
          <p>Urine has various wastes dissolved in it. When there is too much waste in too little liquid, crystals begin to form. The crystals attract other elements and join together to form a solid that will get larger unless it is passed out of the body with the urine. Usually, these chemicals are eliminated in the urine by the body's master chemist: the kidney. In most people, having enough liquid washes them out or other chemicals in urine stop a stone from forming. The stone-forming chemicals are calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate.</p>
<p>After it is formed, the stone may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract into the ureter. Sometimes, tiny stones move out of the body in the urine without causing too much pain. But stones that don't move may cause a back-up of urine in the kidney, ureter, the bladder, or the urethra. This is what causes the pain.

          <p> Some kidney stones are as small as a grain of sand. Others are as large as a pebble. A few are as large as a golf ball! As a general rule, the larger the stone, the more noticeable are the symptoms.</p>
          <p>The symptoms could be one or more of the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>severe pain on either side of your lower back              </li>
          <li>more vague pain or stomach ache that doesn't go away       </li>

          </ul>
          <p>
The kidney stone starts to hurt when it causes irritation or blockage. This builds rapidly to extreme pain. In most cases, kidney stones pass without causing damage-but usually not without causing a lot of pain. Pain relievers may be the only treatment needed for small stones. Other treatment may be needed, especially for those stones that cause lasting symptoms or other complications. In severe cases, however, surgery may be required.

          <p>Factors that increase your risk of developing kidney stones include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Family or personal history:</strong> If someone in your family has had kidney stones, you're more likely to develop stones, too. If you've already had one or more kidney stones, you're at increased risk of developing another.</li>
              <li><strong>Dehydration: </strong> Not drinking enough water each day can increase your risk of kidney stones. People who live in warm, dry climates and those who sweat a lot may be at higher risk than others.</li>
              <li><strong>Certain diets: </strong> Eating a diet that's high in protein, sodium (salt) and sugar may increase your risk of some types of kidney stones. This is especially true with a high-sodium diet. Too much salt in your diet increases the amount of calcium your kidneys must filter and significantly increases your risk of kidney stones.</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity: </strong> High body mass index (BMI), large waist size and weight gain have been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones.</li>
              <li><strong>Digestive diseases and surgery: </strong>Gastric bypass surgery, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea can cause changes in the digestive process that affect your absorption of calcium and water, increasing the amounts of stone-forming substances in your urine.</li>
              <li>Other medical conditions such as renal tubular acidosis, cystinuria, hyperparathyroidism and repeated urinary tract infections also can increase your risk of kidney stones.</li>
              <li>Certain supplements and medications, such as vitamin C, dietary supplements, laxatives (when used excessively), calcium-based antacids, and certain medications used to treat migraines or depression, can increase your risk of kidney stones</li>

          <p><strong>Shock-wave lithotripsy</strong> is a noninvasive procedure that uses high-energy sound waves to blast the stones into fragments that are then more easily passed out in the urine. </p>
          <p>In <strong>ureteroscopy</strong>, an endoscope is inserted through the ureter to retrieve or obliterate the stone. </p>
          <p>Rarely, for very large or complicated stones, doctors will use percutaneous <strong>nephrolithotomy/nephrolithotripsy</strong>.</p>

        <p>Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys. Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function. But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts aren't cancer and rarely cause problems.

It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. Often, one cyst occurs on the surface of a kidney. But more than one cyst can appear on one or both kidneys. Simple kidney cysts aren't the same as cysts that form with polycystic kidney disease. Simple cysts also differ from complex cysts. Complex cysts need to be watched for changes that could be cancer.

Simple kidney cysts are often found during an imaging test for another condition. Treatment usually isn't needed unless simple cysts cause symptoms.

          <li>Dull pain in the back or side</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Upper stomach pain</li>
      </ul>
        </p>

          <p>Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of a kidney cyst.</p>

        <p>It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. One theory suggests that kidney cysts develop when the surface layer
            of the kidney weakens and forms a pouch. The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst.</p>

        Doctors are not sure why simple kidney cysts form. Other than aging, there are no real risk factors for developing
          simple kidney cysts. Interestingly, diet and lifestyle factors do not seem to impact the risk of developing these cysts.
        Simple kidney cysts are fairly common as people age, however. In fact, up to 25 percent of adults over age 40 and half of
          those over 50 develop simple kidney cysts at some point.
        Additionally, men may be slightly more likely to develop simple kidney cysts than women.

          <p>Kidney cysts that cause symptoms may require treatment, particularly if they block the flow of urine or blood through the kidneys. In these cases, a doctor may recommend draining the cyst, using a procedure called sclerotherapy.</p>
          <p>During sclerotherapy, a doctor uses ultrasound to guide a needle to the cyst. The sac of fluid is then punctured with the needle and drained.</p>
          <p>Next, the doctor will inject a saline solution into the area to harden the surrounding tissue and prevent another cyst from forming. The procedure is done using local anaesthesia and on an outpatient basis.</p>

        <p>The kidneys are organs in the abdomen that remove waste and extra water from the blood (as urine), and help keep chemicals (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) balanced in the body. The kidneys also make hormones that help control blood pressure and stimulate bone marrow to make red blood cells. Kidney tumors (also called renal tumors) are growths in the kidneys that can be benign or cancerous. Most do not cause symptoms and are discovered unexpectedly when you are being diagnosed and treated for another condition.

          <p> Types of benign kidney tumors include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Renal adenoma :</strong> Renal adenomas are the most common form of benign, solid kidney   tumor, and are typically small, low-grade growths. Their cause is unknown.</li>
              <li><strong>Renal oncocytoma :</strong> Oncocytoma is a benign, usually asymptomatic tumor that can grow quite large. They can develop throughout the body and are not unique to the kidneys. Their cause is also unknown, and they appear with greater frequency in men than in women.</li>

              <li><strong>Angiomyolipoma :</strong> Also known as renal hamartoma, angiomyolipomas are rare, benign tumors that can be caused by an inherited genetic mutation. They can occur on an isolated, individual basis, but most often are associated with a rare genetic disease called tuberous sclerosis, which can cause tumors in the skin, kidneys, brain and other organ systems. In patients without tuberous sclerosis, these tumors most often occur in middleaged women.</li>

              <li><strong>Fibroma :</strong> Fibromas are tumors of the fibrous tissue on, in or surrounding the kidney. They are rare and more common in women. Their cause is unknown and most do not cause symptoms.</li>

              <li><strong>Lipoma :</strong> Lipomas are rare renal tumors originating in the fat cells within the renal capsule or surrounding tissue. Lipomas typically occur in middle-aged women.</li>

          <p>If a kidney tumor is malignant, it is kidney cancer. The two main types of kidney cancer are <strong>renal cell cancer</strong> and <strong>transitional cell cancer</strong>. In adults, renal cell cancer, which begins in the lining of small tubes inside the kidney, is most common. Transitional cell cancer is far less common. Wilms’ tumor, another type of kidney cancer, is most frequently seen in children.</p>
